# ======================================
# These rules are from:
# Mac OS X Security Configuration Guide
# For Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard
# http://www.apple.com/support/security/guides/
# The IPFW2 Firewall

# Combined together and slightly modified by:

# ======================================
# Implementing a Basic Inclusive Ruleset
# ======================================

# Allow all traffic to us from our loopback interface
add 1000 allow all from any to any via lo0

# The default outbound rules:
# Allow all TCP and UDP packets out, and keep state to allow responses
add 10000 allow tcp from any to any out keep-state
add 12000 allow udp from any to any out keep-state

# Or:
# Allow all traffic out, and keep state to allow responses
# add 10000 allow ip from any to any out keep-state

# Allow ICMP out
add 12001 allow icmp from any to any out

# Allow all ICMP traffic
# add 20000 allow log icmp from any to any

# Allow DHCP packets in (use only if using DHCP)
add 60000 allow udp from any to any src-port 67 dst-port 68 in

# Reject all IP packets: anything not matched is dropped and logged
add 65534 deny log ip from any to any

# Allow all IP packets: here as a reminder of the default rule
# add 65535 allow ip from any to any

# =========================================
# Making the Basic Ruleset More Restrictive
# =========================================

# To deny traffic addressed for the loopback interface but not originating from it
add 1010 deny all from any to 127.0.0.0/8

# To restrict ICMP traffic, you must remove rule 20000 above, which accepts
# all ICMP packets, and then choose which types of ICMP packets to allow. Some
# ICMP types such as those for message redirection and router solicitation are
# not typically needed.
# 
# The following ICMP types are frequently judged necessary for network
# operation, and other ICMP types are denied:

# to allow destination unreachable messages
add 20001 allow icmp from any to any icmptypes 3

# to allow source quench / congestion control messages
add 20002 allow icmp from any to any icmptypes 4

# Allow ping responses (echo replies) in
add 20004 allow icmp from any to any icmptypes 0 in

# Allow "time exceeded" responses -- lets traceroute work 
add 20005 allow icmp from any to any icmptypes 11 in

# Note: If Stealth Mode is enabled using the Security preference pane, the
# rule here takes precedence because it has a lower number (20010) than the
# system applies for Stealth Mode (33000).
# 
# Packet fragmentation can be normal in some network environments. However, if
# your network environment does not have packet fragmentation, fragmented
# packets can be a sign of abnormal activity.

# The following rule drops fragmented packets:
# add 700 deny log ip from any to any frag

# ============================================
# Opening the Basic Ruleset to Permit Services
# ============================================

# Address examples:
# 10.0.0.0/24       = 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255
# 10.0.0.0/16       = 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.255.255
# 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} = 10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.99

# Allow all from trusted IP's
# add 12600 allow all from 10.0.0.0/24 to any in

# Allow Bonjour
# add 12600 allow udp from 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} to any dst-port 5353
# add 12601 allow udp from 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} 5353 to any dst-port 1024-65535 in

# Allow Apple Remote Desktop
# add 12900 allow ip from 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} to any dst-port 3283 in
# add 12901 allow ip from 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} to any dst-port 5900 in

# Allow the Remote Login (SSH) service to be reached
# add 12500 allow tcp from 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} to any 22
# add 12501 allow udp from 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} to any 22

# Allow the system to host File Sharing over AFP
# add 12700 allow tcp from 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} to any dst-port 548

# Allow the Web Sharing service
# add 14000 allow tcp from 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} to any dst-port 80 
# add 14000 allow tcp from 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} to any dst-port 443

# Allow File Sharing over SMB
# add 12801 allow udp from 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} 137,138,139 to me in keep-state
# add 12803 allow tcp from 10.0.0.0/24{1-99} 137,138,139 to me keep-state setup
